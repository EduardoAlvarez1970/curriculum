# Curriculum Purpose
The MDN front-end developer curriculum is intended to provide an up-to-date industry recommendation for the key fundamental skills and knowledge that a front-end web developer should have. This curriculum is useful for several groups of people:

- Students who want to get a job in the industry, which may involve gaining a related qualification or certification. The curriculum will act as a guide for what they should study.
- Existing web developers who want to “level up” their skills, making sure their skillset is current and identifying gaps in their knowledge that they should learn more about.
- Non-front-end web developers who have existing development experience in other areas (for example back-end web developers or native platform developers), who wish to get into front-end web development and want a guide to the topics they should learn.
- Educators creating programs, units, and assessment specifications for a web-related university degree, college course, coding school course, or similar. Educators/course creators should aim to make their courses conform to this curriculum.

We want this resource to help web developers have the best possible chance of success. By this, we mean:

- Success for newcomers to the web industry in getting a job.
- Success in building high-quality websites and applications that are performant, usable, and accessible.
- Success in establishing a long-lasting career in the web industry.

The MDN front-end developer curriculum is an outcome of the research the MDN team conducted in earlier 2023, regarding our users' expectations in regards to learning on MDN and elsewhere. 

Part of our focus for 2023 is into making MDN a resource where people don't only come to look up for reference, but they get the help they need for learning new things on MDN. Back in 2019 we launched the Learning Area -  to help more junior developers into learning the basics. This part of MDN has proven to be highly successful, with about 10% of our audience consulting it. While, the Learning Area contains a lot of interesting content, it still needs solid guidance on what new front-end devs should learn, and in what order, to be successful in the web industry.

## Contributing
We would love to hear your feedback regarding our Curriculum. To do so, please open an issue and [leave your feedback under General feedback or Topic coverage](https://github.com/mdn/curriculum/issues/new/choose). When doing so, think of the following questions:

- Does our curriculum contain all the fundamental knowledge a front-end web developer needs? If not, what topics are we missing? We are interested in high-level concerns (for example "this whole area is missing") as well as lower-level feedback (for example, specific CSS or JavaScript omissions)
- Do you think the curriculum is helpful to its key target audiences, for example students wanting to learn front-end development, and teachers wishing to create courses on it? If not, why not?

### 3.1 Basic CSS syntax

Learning outcomes:

- The purpose of CSS — to style, layout, and provide other visual enhancements to web pages (such as animation).

- Key CSS syntax

  - Rules

  - Selectors

  - Declarations

  - Properties

    - Custom properties

  - Values

    - Shorthand values

  - At-rules and descriptors

- Default browser styles — understand that the browser provides default CSS styling to HTML elements so that it is in some way usable even with no user-defined styles at all.

  - Understand also therefore that HTML has nothing to do with styling.

  - Use this to reinforce the idea of separating semantics and structure (semantic HTML) from presentation (CSS), and not using presentational markup.

  - Study CSS resets, first to prove that browser styles exist and show what a page looks like when they are removed, but also as a technique for providing a blank canvas for developers to build their own styles on.

- Applying CSS to an HTML document — inline styles, internal stylesheets, external stylesheets

  - Why external stylesheets are usually the best option

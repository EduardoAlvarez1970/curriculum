### 3.2 Selectors and combinators

Learning outcomes:

- Basic selectors — element type, class, ID

  - IDs are unique per document — you should use an ID to select one specific element.

  - You can have multiple classes per element, and these can be used to layer on styles as required.

  - IDs and classes should be used sparingly when it makes sense for getting the selections you want, but you shouldn't use them for everything — keep your HTML as clean and uncluttered as possible.

- Selector lists

- Attribute selectors

- Combinators

- Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

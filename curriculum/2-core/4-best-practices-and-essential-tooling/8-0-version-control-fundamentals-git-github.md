## 8 Version control fundamentals (Git/GitHub)

Version control tools are an essential part of modern workflows, for backing up and collaborating on codebases. This module takes you through the essentials of version control using Git and GitHub.

Learning outcomes:

- Understand why version control systems are necessary

- Understand that sites such as GitHub, GitLab, etc. enable teamwork and collaboration that wasn't so easy in the past

- Understand the difference between Git, and websites like GitHub or GitLab

- Basic setup — installing git, signing up for an account for your chosen social coding site

  - Handling security requirements, like SSH/GPG keys

- Creating a repo

- Pushing changes — `add`, `commit`, `push`

- Contributing to others' repos

  - Forking

  - Creating a new branch

  - Creating a PR

  - Review flow

  - Keeping your fork updated

- Using GitHub pages to publish a sample project

- Good housekeeping

  - Use `.gitignore` to ignore all the stuff you don't want to commit, for example, dependencies and dev source files

  - Delete branches you've finished with

- Handling merge conflicts

> **Notes:**
>
> - Git and associated social coding sites like GitHub have a lot of functionality, and can be intimidating and unfriendly to begin with. This set of conformance criteria does not expect mastery of all aspects of these tools, but rather an understanding of the basics, and why it is necessary to have some experience here before entering the industry.
> - Git is the web industry standard for version control, and has been for some time.

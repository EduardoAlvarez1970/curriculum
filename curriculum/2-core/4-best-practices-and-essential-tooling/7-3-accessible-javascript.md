### 7.3 Accessible JavaScript

Learning outcomes:

- Understand that there is such a thing as too much JavaScript. A simpler approach is usually more accessible, and often better for everyone

- Understand the value of unobtrusive JavaScript.

  - If possible, use JavaScript as a usability enhancement, which isn't essential for the app to function

  - A good example is client-side validation of form inputs

- Use events sensibly so as not to lock out specific control types (for example, mouse-specific events such as `mouseover` and `mouseout` could lock out keyboard or touchscreen users).

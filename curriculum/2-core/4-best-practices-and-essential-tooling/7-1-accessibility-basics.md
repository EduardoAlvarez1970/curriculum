### 7.1 Accessibility basics

Learning outcomes:

- Understand the point of accessibility — increased usability for everyone, better SEO, and a wider target audience. Also be aware of the legal requirements.

- Understand that accessibility should be considered from the start of a project, and not bolted on at the end.

- Understand the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) conference criteria.

- Use semantic HTML, aka "The right element for the right job", because the browser provides so many built-in accessibility hooks. Good examples are `<a>` and `<input>` elements.

- Accessible best practices

  - Alt text (see also [2.6 Media](../1-web-standards-and-html/2-6-media.md))

  - Link text (see also [2.5 Links](../1-web-standards-and-html/2-5-links.md))

  - `<label>`s for form elements (see also [2.7 Other interactive elements](../1-web-standards-and-html/2-7-other-interactive-elements.md))

  - Mobile UIs that provide specific usability advantages for specific input types such as `number` or `tel`

  - Make tables accessible with `<th>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tfoot>`, `<caption>`, and the `scope` attribute (See also [2.8 HTML tables](../1-web-standards-and-html/2-8-html-tables.md)).

  - Use simple plain language, steer clear of slang and abbreviations where possible, and provide definitions where it is not possible.

- Understand the purpose of audio transcripts and text tracks (captions, subtitles, etc.) in making audio and video content accessible (we are not expecting mastery in creating them; that is an advanced topic in its own right).

- Keyboard accessibility:

  - Understand why apps need to be keyboard accessible — many people have difficulty using a mouse or other pointing device

  - Understand the browser-provided keyboard controls

  - Understand when `accesskey` and `tabindex` are appropriate to use

### 7.5 WAI-ARIA

Learning outcomes:

- Understand the purpose of WAI-ARIA — to provide semantics to otherwise non-semantic HTML, so that AT users can make sense of the interfaces being presented to them.

  - Using semantic HTML is an ideal, which is not possible at all times. WAI-ARIA is a bridging technology for such cases

- The basic syntax — roles, properties, and states.

- Landmarks and signposting.

- Enhancing keyboard accessibility.

- Announcing dynamic content updates with live regions.

- [The first rule of ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1): "If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so."

- [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) (a set of useful ARIA design patterns)

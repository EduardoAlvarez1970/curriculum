## 9 Design theory for developers

The idea of this module is to introduce developers to some design thinking. They may not want to work as a designer, but having some basic user experience and design theory under their belt will be invaluable for understanding design briefs, making their portfolios look better, and getting into the mindset of the user.

In addition, front-end developers are often tasked with doing various bits of design work on projects. Clients and employers often assume that they can do it because they are involved with the visual elements of the website.

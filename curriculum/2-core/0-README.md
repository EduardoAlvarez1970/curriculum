# Core modules

> Note: Intro and TOC for the "Core" section only.

The core modules include the topics that we feel every web developer should have a good grounding in. This includes all the information they need to design and build a basic, accessible web app that follows modern best practices, and manage and deploy their code using a tool like GitHub.

## Section contents

- [1 The web standards model](/curriculum/2-core/1-the-web-standards-model.md): The fundamentals of how the web works at a high level, including the model used for communication, the core technologies involved, how those technologies are created, and how a web browser renders and displays websites to a user.

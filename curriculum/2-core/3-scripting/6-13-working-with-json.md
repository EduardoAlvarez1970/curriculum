- Understand that JSON can also contain arrays

- Retrieve JSON as a JavaScript object using mechanisms available in Web APIs (e.g. `Response.json()` in the Fetch API).

- Access values inside JSON data using object bracket and dot syntax.

- Converting between objects and text using `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()`.

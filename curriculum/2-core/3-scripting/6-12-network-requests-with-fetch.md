### 6.12 Network requests with fetch()

- Understand that [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) is used for asynchronous network requests, which is by far the most common async JavaScript use case on the web.

- Common types of resources that are fetched from the network.

  - Text content, [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON), media assets, etc.

  - [RESTful APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/REST), and the basic concepts behind them â€” common patterns such as [CRUD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CRUD)

- Understand what SPAs are, and the issues surrounding them:

  - Accessibility issues behind asynchronous updates, for example, content updates not being announced by screen readers by default.

  - Usability issues behind asynchronous updates, like loss of history and breaking the back button.

- Crash course in [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) basics. We've already talked about `GET`-ing resources, but you should also look at other common HTTP verbs, such as `DELETE`, `POST`, and `PUT`, and how they are handled via `fetch()`.

# Core modules

> Note: Intro and TOC for the "Core" section only.

The core modules include the topics that we feel every web developer should have a good grounding in. This includes all the information they need to design and build a basic, accessible web app that follows modern best practices, and manage and deploy their code using a tool like GitHub.

## Section contents

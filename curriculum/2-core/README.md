# Core modules

The core modules include the topics that we feel every web developer should have a good grounding in. This includes all the information they need to design and build a basic, accessible web app that follows modern best practices, and manage and deploy their code using a tool like GitHub.

## Section contents

- [1 The web standards model](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/1-0-the-web-standards-model.md): The fundamentals of how the web works at a high level, including the model used for communication, the core technologies involved, how those technologies are created, and how a web browser renders and displays websites to a user.
  - [1.1 How the web works](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/1-1-how-the-web-works.md)
  - [1.2 The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript triangle](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/1-2-the-html-css-and-javascript-triangle.md)
  - [1.3 Web standards](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/1-3-web-standards.md)
  - [1.4 How browsers work](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/1-4-how-browsers-work.md)
- [2 Semantic HTML](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/2-0-semantic-html.md): HTML is the technology that defines the content and structure of any website. Written properly, it should also define the semantics (meaning) of the content in a machine-readable way, which is vital for accessibility, search engine optimization, and tapping into using the built-in features browsers provide for content to work optimally. This module covers the basics of the language, before looking at key areas such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.

  - [2.2 Good document structure](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/2-2-good-document-structure.md)
  - [2.3 Lists](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/2-3-lists.md)

  - [2.5 Links](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/2-5-links.md)
  - [2.6 Media](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/2-6-media.md)
  - [2.7 Other interactive elements](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/2-7-other-interactive-elements.md)
  - [2.8 HTML tables](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/2-8-html-tables.md)
  - [2.9 Debugging HTML](/curriculum/2-core/1-standards-and-semantics/2-9-debugging-html.md)

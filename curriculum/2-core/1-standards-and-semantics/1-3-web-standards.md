### 1.3 Web standards

Learning outcomes:

- The [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) and other standards bodies (such as [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/), [TC39](https://tc39.es/), and [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/)), and how they operate

- The process of standards creation

- The lifecycle of web standards features

  - Experimental (usually only available in one browser engine as it is developed, sometimes not in a specification yet. Too early to use in production.)

  - Stable (development finished, specified, available across browser engines)

  - Deprecated (not to be used anymore, may still be in browsers but flagged for deletion)

- The key principles web standards are built on

  - Open to contribute and use

  - Not patent-encumbered, or controlled by a single private entity

  - Accessible and interoperable

  - Don't break the web

> **Notes:**
>
> - The basic principles of the web â€” interoperable, accessible, collaborative, and not owned by a single corporation.
> - This basis means that the web is a unique and exciting industry to get involved in.
> - The full W3C standards process is deep and academic. For now, you should understand how different individuals and companies get involved in the standards process, and how the different maturity stages are designed to weed out issues (e.g. interoperability issues, patent issues).

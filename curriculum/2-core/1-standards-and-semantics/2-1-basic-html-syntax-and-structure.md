### 2.1 Basic HTML syntax and structure

Learning outcomes:

- The need for a doctype at the top of an HTML document. Its original intended purpose, and the fact that now it is somewhat of a historical artifact.

- The need to set the language of a document using the `lang` attribute in the opening `<html>` tag

- The HTML head, and its purpose as a metadata container for the document including key uses

  - Setting information like character encoding and title.

  - Providing metadata for search engines (e.g. `<meta name="description">`) and social media platforms (e.g. [Open Graph Data](https://ogp.me/)), and the Search Engine Optimization (SEO) benefits.

  - Linking to icons for use on browsers and mobile platforms.

  - Linking to stylesheets and script files.

- The HTML body and its purpose as a container for the page content.

- The anatomy of an HTML element â€” element, opening tag, content, closing tag, attributes.

- What [void elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/Void_element) (also known as empty elements) are and how they differ from standard elements.

# Precursor knowledge

The topics outlined in this section are not web development topics, but they do constitute useful topics for anyone wanting to learn front-end web development to have an understanding of. We don't consider learning these topics as required before moving on to the core sections, hence we haven't used the word "prerequisite". However, we believe students will have an easier time if they spend some time on these topics first.

## Section contents

- [Recommended soft skills](/curriculum/1-precursor/1-soft-skills.md): Recommendations of soft skills that students can aim to get better at while learning web development, and which constitute good traits to have when entering the industry

# Extension 7 A practical understanding of JavaScript frameworks

JavaScript frameworks are commonly used to build web applications, so it is beneficial to learn about common frameworks and use cases (as listed below) for employment prospects.

> **Notes:**
>
> - Conforming to this set of criteria does not involve becoming a master of a particular framework and learning everything it has to offer. To do so can be limiting â€” one framework might be the most popular choice now, but in five years everything could change.
> - Instead, we want to encourage students to get a solid understanding of the JavaScript fundamentals frameworks are built on top of (see [6 JavaScript fundamentals](../2-core/6-javascript-fundamentals.md)), and learn the common features and patterns that frameworks use. This approach is much more flexible and future proof.
> - Students are strongly encouraged to start building apps with 2-3 popular frameworks to get a practical understanding of how they do things and idea of the differences between them.
> - Advanced and/or framework-specific features can be learned as part of the student's constant learning.

Learning outcomes:

- Understand how to start using frameworks:

  - Link to the relevant JavaScript files, either locally or on a [CDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Glossary/CDN) (not usually recommended).

  - Use a dependency manager such as npm to add it to your project (sometimes recommended).

  - Install a CLI to generate a framework-based application (such as Create React App, or Ember CLI).

- The fundamentals of a typical framework. The overall architecture will differ, but most frameworks include the following in one form or another, which you should gain experience of:

  - Component systems

    - Props

    - Data binding

    - Event handlers

    - Dependency injection

    - Component lifecycle system

  - Templating language

    - Usually a domain-specific language such as JSX or handlebars

    - But also includes features such as filtering and conditional rendering

  - Rendering system (for example, virtual or incremental DOM)

  - State management

  - Routing

  - Styling system to apply CSS to your components

  - Dependency management

  - Extension system

- Understand the practicalities of working with a framework. Most frameworks have available:

  - A local testing server that refreshes on file save.

  - A useful set of extensions for popular code editors (for example VSCode) that provide features like linting and code completion for framework-specific code.

  - An integrated system for writing tests (see also [Extension 6 Testing](./6-testing.md)).

  - Facilitation for deployment to a remote server (most deployment tools such as Netlify and Vercel have integrations/tooling for working with both GitHub and popular frameworks).

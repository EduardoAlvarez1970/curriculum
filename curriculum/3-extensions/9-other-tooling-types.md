# Extension 9 Other tooling types

> **Notes:**
>
> - Understanding this set of criteria doesn't require having an in-depth knowledge of the tools listed below; instead, students are encouraged to learn the basic concepts of why and how they are used (and where in a web app project), test them out, and play with usage examples.

Learning outcomes — understand the purpose and basic usage of other common tooling types you may be required to use in a web project:

- Linters/formatters, for example [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

  - Detecting potential bugs, and how linters can automatically fix them.

  - The need to have coding standards, and how these tools can easily automate conformance to those standards.

  - Integrating them as part of your workflow — as a code editor extension, as part of your test runner, as part of a CI run.

- Package managers, for example [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

  - Using these as a way to manage project dependencies as a codebase becomes more complex.

  - Finding suitable packages to solve your problems from registries and installing them.

  - Using scripts (for example npm scripts) to make deployment, testing, etc. easier.

- Build tools/bundlers, for example [Rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), or [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).

  - Using these to manage dependencies, and organize, optimize, and minify your code into build files for improved performance.

- Deployment tools, e.g. Simple FTP, and more sophisticated tools like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

  - Using these for deployments of your applications.

  - Integrating tooling with GitHub to provide automatic test deployments on push.

  - Handling of custom domains, serverless functions, and form submissions.

  - Handling access control, integration with identity providers such as Okta/Auth0.

  - Integrations with popular frameworks and app platforms.

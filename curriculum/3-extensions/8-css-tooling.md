# Extension 8 CSS tooling

## 8.1 CSS frameworks

Learning outcomes:

- Understand the value that CSS frameworks bring — consistency, organization, ready-made components and style guidelines, best practices built in.

- Understand the problems with CSS frameworks — for small projects they are often overkill (in terms of complexity and file size), new syntax to learn, your sites will start to look like everyone else's, and they are often hard to override if you want to customize them.

- Understand the basics of using popular CSS frameworks such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](https://get.foundation/), or [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

- Understand how they integrate into a web project.

- Understand how to weigh up the burden of adopting a CSS framework (e.g. handling integration, initial learning curve) versus the advantages (how much they can speed up development once you are familiar with them).

> **Notes:**
>
> - Whatever framework your course or learning includes, the tool's site should include information on the basics of using it.
> - The aim here is not to have an exhaustive understanding of any one framework, but rather to understand the pros and cons, what a CSS framework can do, and what general usage looks like.

## 8.2 CSS preprocessors

Learning outcomes:

- Understanding the value of CSS preprocessors — bringing features to CSS that are not available natively (such as loops or if/else structures), and speeding up the writing of your own code.

- Understand the problems with CSS preprocessors — for small projects they are often overkill (in terms of complexity, setup, and file size), and they bring new syntax to learn.

- Understand the basics of using popular CSS preprocessors such as [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)

- Understand how they integrate into a web project.

- Understand how to weigh up the burden of adopting a CSS preprocessor (e.g. handling integration, initial learning curve) versus the advantages (how much they can speed up writing your CSS once you are familiar with them).
